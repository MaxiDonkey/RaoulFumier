## Abstract

Voice software only currently available in French language only. 

Strengths: Possibility of executing several commands simultaneously allowing better immersion in the game
No settings are required to benefit from all the commands allowed with Elite Dangerous and more ...
It is also possible to navigate under Windows and in many software, including access to the list of 
running processes and access to the Windows taskbar.

This software is strongly recommended in addition to the EDTaupeEye software (https://github.com/MaxiDonkey/EDTaupeEye) 
to fully benefit from the commands of Elite Dangerous and thus allow people with disabilities to continue 
the great adventure offered by Frontier through from Elite Dangerous.
